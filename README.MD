# Lucas Simpson 🦀

> Systems programming in Rust — building a small operating system, its userland, and the tooling used to run and understand it.

---

## 🚀 Start Here
> The central integration point where boot, memory, and execution come together.

| **Userland** | Kernel support libraries & primitives | [userland support libraries](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/sys-userland-kernel-rust) |
| **Laboratory** | How the OS boots and runs locally | [qemu homelab runner](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/sys-qemu-homelab) |
| **Understanding** | Notes and explanations | [Notes blog](https://lucassimpson0213.github.io/notes-blog/) |
