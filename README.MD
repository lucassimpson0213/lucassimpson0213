# Lucas Simpson

I build systems software in Rust — an operating system, its userland foundations, and the tooling and lab environment around it.

This GitHub is not a collection of projects.  
It is a single evolving system.

## Start Here

If you only open one repository:

➡ https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/os_dev_reorg

This is the central OS development work.

## The System (read in this order)

### 1. The Kernel
Low-level OS and memory work.

- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/os_dev_reorg
- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/sys-userland-kernel-rust
- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/heap_allocator

### 2. The Laboratory
Infrastructure used to run and test the OS.

- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/sys-qemu-homelab

### 3. The Tooling
Environment and utilities that support development.

- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/nvim-config
- https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/dotfiles

### 4. Understanding & Documentation
Where I turn debugging into knowledge.

## How I Work

- Tests running constantly
- Document invariants next to `unsafe`
- Prefer understanding over abstraction
- Build tools I can depend on

Pinned repositories are the curated entry points.
