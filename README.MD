# Lucas Simpson

I build systems software in Rust — an operating system, its userland primitives, and the tooling needed to run and understand it.

This GitHub is one continuous project: a small computing environment built from the hardware up.

## Start here
➡ [os_dev_reorg — main OS development](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/os_dev_reorg)

---

## The system

### Kernel
- [os_dev_reorg](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/os_dev_reorg)
- [heap_allocator](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/heap_allocator)

### Laboratory (how it runs)
- [sys-qemu-homelab](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/sys-qemu-homelab)

### Understanding (how I learn from it)
- [Notes blog](https://lucassimpson0213.github.io/notes-blog/)

---

## Active work
- [Open tasks & investigations](https://github.com/lucassimpson0213/ideas/issues)

---

## How I work
- tests always running
- document invariants near `unsafe`
- minimal tooling, maximal understanding
- build tools I can depend on
