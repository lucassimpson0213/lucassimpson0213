# Lucas Simpson

I build systems software in Rust — an operating system, its userland primitives, and the tooling needed to run and understand it.

This GitHub is one continuous project: a small computing environment built from the hardware up.

## How I work
- tests always running
- document invariants near `unsafe`
- minimal tooling, maximal understanding
- build tools I can depend on
