# Lucas Simpson

Systems programming in Rust — building an operating system and its userland foundations.

---

## Start Here

* **kernel** — the OS itself
* **libvert** — verified low-level primitives (parsers, allocators, data structures)
* **scratch** — experiments and learning

---

## What I’m Working On

* memory map parsing (Multiboot)
* allocators (bump → slab)
* virtual memory concepts
* unsafe Rust reasoning & invariants

---

## How I Work

* tests always running on save
* document invariants next to unsafe
* keep tooling minimal

---

## Topics I Care About

Rust • operating systems • memory management • debugging undefined behavior • computer architecture

Pinned repos are the entry point.
